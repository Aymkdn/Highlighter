#Highlighter

A plugin for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) to highlight mixed
tabs and spaces, some unicode characters and trailing space.

You can also add a custom regex for characters to highlight.

See the default settings file if you want to customise

This plugin used to be called *Highlight Mixed Whitespace*, now renamed because it does a little more now.

Shamelessly ripped from https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces and modified.
